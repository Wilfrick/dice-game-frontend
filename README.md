# dice-game-frontend

This will serve as the frontend for an online dice game.

Built with React + Vite

This is currently a work in progress.


# Usage
To serve the app in dev mode use `npm run dev`. To build and then serve in production mode (using a local testing server) use `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`

To see the game in action you will need to run the back end, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Wilfrick/dice-game-backend)

Once the server is running, use the 'Start Game' button to start a game. Then different player bets can be made. Again, please note that this is currently a work in progress.
